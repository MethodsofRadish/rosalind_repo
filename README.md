# rosalind_repo
My attempts to complete the http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/ Challenge. Some attempts will have more than one solution as I think of them. 

The goal of this reposititory is to complete the problem sets found at http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/. 
I will attempt to solve each problem in more than one way using Python 3.#. Time permitting I would like to attempt Java solutions. 

I plan on using the command line (Terminal on Mac) to call and run the program with text files. 

The program will follow a similar outline and style has presented below:

*Introduction including date, name, problem and expected solution. 

*Open and read in the file

*Have the "main" body of the program that calls a method to perform a function once the file is open

*Perform the operation using a method and return or print the answer

I will strive to explain my logic and process through the use of comments in the code.
