# rosalind_repo 2020 - 2021
My attempts to complete the http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/ Challenge. Some attempts will have more than one solution as I think of them. 

The file names are based on the Rosalind Shorthand naming conventions listed for each challenge identification (ID). These ID codes consist of two, three or four uppercase letters. I have used these ID's to identify the code ID.py in my repository (repo). 

The goal of this reposititory is to complete the problem sets found at http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/. 
I will attempt to solve each problem in more than one way using Python 3.#. Time permitting I would like to attempt Java solutions. 

I plan on using the command line interface (CLI on Terminal on Mac) to call and run the program with examples from Rosalind copied into a text (example.txt) file. 

The program will follow a similar outline and style has presented below:

*Introduction including date, name, problem and expected solution. 

*Open and read in the file

*Have the "main" body of the program that calls a method to perform a function once the file is open

*Perform the operation using a method and return or print the answer

I will strive to explain my logic and process through the use of comments in the code. If something is not clear and could be explained better. Let me know!

Likewise, if you have an alternative solution, Let me know!
